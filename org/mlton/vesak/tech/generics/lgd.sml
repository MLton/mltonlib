(* Type representation datatype. *)

structure Type = struct
   datatype t =
      UNIT
    | INT
    | SUM  of t Sq.t

    | FIX  of t Ref.t * t
    | VAR  of t Ref.t

   val Y =
       Tie.pure
          (fn () => let
                 val r = ref UNIT
              in
                 (VAR r, fn t => let val t = FIX (r, t) in r := t ; t end)
              end)
end

(*
 * Note the {FIX} and {VAR} constructors.  They are used to encode
 * recursive types.  The point here is to make it possible to implement a
 * fixed point witness, using the {Tie} module from the Extended Basis
 * Library, for the type constructor of an arbitrary generic (structural
 * cases).  IOW, we do not only compute a fixed point of the type
 * representation, but we also want to make it possible to compute a fixed
 * point of a given generic for the recursive type at hand.  In order to
 * do this, we are very explicit about recursion.

(*
 * The universal type and isomorphisms above implement the "poor man's
 * existentials" mentioned at the beginning.  See [1] for the (trivial)
 * Haskell version using existentials.
 *
 * Note the thunks in the sum and product cases.  The idea is to perform
 * coercions lazily.  For example, if you evaluate
 *
 *> equal (list int) ([], veryLongList)
 *
 * then only the first sum of the {veryLongList} should be coerced.
 *
 * Note also that the thunks do not appear in the {CASES}.  The framework
 * handles data coercions automatically behind the scenes.  This is
 * different from both Cheney & Hinze's and Weeks' approaches and leads to
 * comparatively concise definitions of generics (see {Eq} and {Ord} at
 * the end).
 *)


(* Signature for generics. *)

signature GENERIC = sig
   type 'a t
   val apply : 'a Type.t -> 'a t
end


(*
 * Functor to build a generic given the structural cases.
 *
 * What this does is to morph the structural cases to work
 *)

functor Generic (C : CASES) : GENERIC = struct
   open Type C

   fun lookup r = Option.map Pair.snd o List.find (eq r o Pair.fst) o !
   fun insert (r, g) p = if isSome (lookup r p) then () else List.push p (r, g)

   val unit = iso unit (swap isoUnit)
   val int  = iso int  (swap isoInt)

   val isoSum  = swap (isoSum  <--> swap Thunk.isoValue)
   val isoProd = swap (isoProd <--> swap Thunk.isoValue)

   fun mk (p, t) =
       case t
        of UNIT        => unit
         | INT         => int
         | SUM  (l, r) => iso (mk (p, l) +` mk (p, r)) isoSum
         | PROD (l, r) => iso (mk (p, l) *` mk (p, r)) isoProd
         | VAR r       => mk (p, !r)
         | FIX (r, t)  => case lookup r p
                           of SOME g => g
                            | NONE   =>
                              Tie.fix Y (fn g => (insert (r, g) p ; mk (p, t)))

   fun apply (T (tU, e)) = iso (mk (ref [], tU)) e
end

(*
 * Note the treatment of recursive types.  To compute fixed points of the
 * generics (structural cases) we keep a (mutable) map of computed fixed
 * points.  Note that it is possible to get to a {VAR} without going
 * through a corresponding {FIX}, which is why the above calls {mk} in the
 * {VAR} case (the reference {r} points to the corresponding {FIX}).
 *)


(* Finally we seal the type representation. *)

structure Type : CASES = Type


(* Note that (all of) the above is part of the framework (one time cost). *)


(* Then we add a couple of type representation constructors. *)

structure Type = struct
   open Type

   fun option a =
       iso (unit +` a)
           (fn NONE => INL () | SOME a => INR a,
            fn INL () => NONE | INR a => SOME a)

   fun list a =
       (Tie.fix Y)
          (fn list_a =>
              iso (unit +` a *` list_a)
                  (fn [] => INL () | x::xs => INR (x & xs),
                   fn INL () => [] | INR (x & xs) => x::xs))

   datatype foo = FOO
                | FOO_BAR of bar
        and bar = BAR
                | BAR_FOO of foo

   val foo & bar =
       let open Tie in fix (Y *` Y) end
          (fn foo & bar =>
              iso (unit +` bar)
                  (fn FOO => INL () | FOO_BAR x => INR x,
                   fn INL () => FOO | INR x => FOO_BAR x) &
              iso (unit +` foo)
                  (fn BAR => INL () | BAR_FOO x => INR x,
                   fn INL () => BAR | INR x => BAR_FOO x))

   datatype useless = USELESS of (useless, useless) Product.t

   val useless =
       (Tie.fix Y)
          (fn useless =>
              iso (useless *` useless)
                  (fn USELESS ? => ?, USELESS))
end


(*
 * Below are implementations of generic equality and ordering relations.
 * The type constraints are for just for clarity.
 *)

structure Eq = Generic
  (open BinPr
   fun iso b (a2b, _) = map a2b b
   val unit = op = : Unit.t t
   val int = op = : Int.t t
   val op +` = Sum.equal
   val op *` = Product.equal
   val Y = Tie.function)

val equal : 'a Type.t -> 'a BinPr.t =
    Eq.apply

structure Ord = Generic
  (open Cmp
   fun iso b (a2b, _) = map a2b b
   val unit = Unit.compare
   val int = Int.compare
   val op +` = Sum.collate
   val op *` = Product.collate
   val Y = Tie.function)

val compare : 'a Type.t -> 'a Cmp.t =
    Ord.apply

(*
 * The above certainly works and the approach could be extended somewhat
 * further.  Try the {equal} and {compare} functions in a REPL!
 *
 * A problem with this approach is mutable types.  They can not be
 * supported through (the ideal) structural cases with specs of the
 * form:
 *
 *> val refc : 'a t -> 'a Ref.t t
 *> val array : 'a t -> 'a Array.t t
 *
 * Another problem with this approach is that the coercions to/from the
 * universal type are likely to have a significant cost.  This problem is
 * mostly due to lack of true existentials.
 *
 * Even with existentials, this approach would suffer from the
 * inflexibility that the user can not specify ad hoc cases [2] for
 * specific datatypes.  For example, picklers based on this approach need
 * to encode lists with a spine---unless the list type constructor is
 * added to the type representation.  IOW, this approach is not modular
 * according to the criteria in [2].
 *
 * One more deficiency with this particular design is the inability of
 * generics to call other generics (from the sum and product cases).  This
 * deficiency could probably be addressed.
