This is an ad-hoc collection of miscellaneous small libraries.

The code is divided into subdirectories as follows:

   public/

      The exported signatures and structures are defined here.  The
      signatures there also serve as documentation.  The contents of
      this directory should be enough to understand how to use the
      libraries.

   tests/

      This directory holds test programs.  Build and run them with the
      command "make check".

   detail/

      The implementations are in the detail/ subdirectory.
